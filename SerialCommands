A	- Enable ADC (must already be powered) - this enables the PD pin on the ADC
a	- Disable ADC (but keep power on) - disables PD pin on ADC - This can also be asserted by a powerdown request
B	- Toggle blue LED
C	- Run ADC calibration
D	- Enable dual edge sampling (DES) on ADC
d	- Disable DES 
E	- Turn on received character echo
e 	- Turn off received character echo

O	- ADC power on - this enables the 1.9V supply and then the 3.3V and 2.5V supplies
o	- ADC power off - disables the 1.9V supply after the 3.3V and 2.5V supplies
P

Q	- Enable Q input on ADC (must already be powered) - enables the PDQ pin 
q	- Disable Q input on ADC (must already be powered) - Unknow behavior if in DES mode
R 	- Toggle red LED
S	- Put ADC in low power (sleep) idle.
