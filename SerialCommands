A	- Enable ADC (must already be powered) - this enables the PD pin on the ADC
a	- Disable ADC (but keep power on) - disables PD pin on ADC - This can also be asserted by a powerdown request
B	- Toggle blue LED
C
c
D	- Enable dual edge sampling (DES) on ADC
d	- Disable DES 
E	- Turn on received character echo
e 	- Turn off received character echo
F

O	- ADC power on - this enables the 1.9V supply
o	- ADC power off - disables the 1.9V supply
P	- Peripheral power on - enables the 3.3V and 2.5V supplies for the ADC peripherals
	  This can only be asserted of the ADC power is also on
p	- Disables peripheral power
Q	- Enable Q input on ADC (must already be powered) - enables the PDQ pin 
q	- Disable Q input on ADC (must already be powered) - Unknow behavior if in DES mode
R 	- Toggle red LED
